Handy 2D Tools by Good Batch Games!
===================================

Welcome to our Handy 2D Tools documentation! Hurray! \\o/

About this project
------------------

This is a **completely free**  collection of handy tools for 2D driven Unity Game developers.

Our goal is to make easy to use and iterative components so you can either use them as they are 
or have a starting point to create something awesome for your game.

We are a small group of people dreaming to build 2D games. While we learn and grow 
as game designers / developers we also want to share what we learn and build. 

Current Version
---------------

   * 1.0.0-alpha

Being this an alpha version we ask you, who got interested enough to be here, to help us 
test both our "philosophy" behind how we compose our tools and the tools we already built.

Speaking of wich, check out :ref:`our crafting principles <crafting-principles-page>` and let us know what you think.

We are now working on a full set of platforming tools and we intend to release a beta version after analysing
the feedback we get from you guys.

Itch Store
----------

Although this tools are free, we use them to build games and (both free and payed) game assets. 

They are released on itch.io and are a way for us to give something worth of your support in order to
to keep creating stuff. Feel free to browse my `itch page <https://goodbatchgames.itch.io>`_ and find something usefull to you there.

Our assets are intended to be fully functional at their purpose. Have in mind that :ref:`patreon supporters <patreon-explanation>` have
access to them.
