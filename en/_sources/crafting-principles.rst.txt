Crafting Principles
===================

Here are the 3 principles I use to craft any component in this package:

1. I interface my purpose - So everyone know how to interact with me.
2. I can seek for information - So you don't need to know me. Just leave an open door and i'll get it.
3. You can directly ask me - In case you prefer to be specific about me.

Before we dive on our principles, have in mind that our components may have any of these traits: 

* Performer - Meaning it exists to perform some kind of action.

* Handler - Meaning it exists to handle another component.

* Provider - Meaning it exists to provide some kind of information.

A component can have multiple traits and a trait represents a purpose for that component to live by.

Ok. Lets get to the principles already.

The "I interface my purpose" principle
--------------------------------------

We ensure components communication by setting  `interfaces <https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface>`_ 
wich expose the traits. 

For example, take our ``DynamicJump`` component. You can attach it to some object, configure it and you will be able to benefit from it. If at any 
time you need a reference to our ``DynamicJump`` component, you would do something like the following:

.. code-block:: csharp

  DynamicJump jump = GetComponent<DynamicJump>();

Ok. Now, the ``DynamicJump`` component must have a handler among the other components of its ``GameObject``. Imagine you have a component wich is 
responsible for handling the actions of the ``GameObject`` it is attached to. And since a jump can be 
considered an action, this particular component would handle the ``DynamicJump`` component and tell it when to perform and stop jumps. 

So, for example, let's say we have a ``PlayableCharacterActions`` component and there we get the reference to the ``DynamicJump`` component:

.. code-block:: csharp

  public class PlayableCharacterActions : MonoBehaviour
  {
    public DynamicJump jump;

    void Start()
    {
      jump = GetComponent<DynamicJump>();
    }
  }

Awesome! From there on we would be able to perform jump stuff by calling the ``DynamicJump`` correct methods. But I consider **you should be free to write 
your own component to handle / perform dynamic  jumps** [#f1]_. Actually, any component you want to write in order to perform anything while interacting with my components, 
i find that you should be able to do it and still benefit from our components wich you see fit as a solution for your game. 

Because of that, ``PlayableCharacterActions`` wouldn't have a reference to the ``DynamicJump`` component. Instead it would declare itself as a "dynamic jump  handler" 
and then allow the ``DynamicJump`` component to find it and listen to events that state what it should do. So... for the sake of a use case example, I 
present to you the ``IJumpHandler`` interface.

Take a look: 

.. code-block:: csharp

  namespace HandyTools.CharacterController.Abilities
  {
      /// <summary>
      /// Any component that implements this interface will be able to handle dynamic  jumps
      /// by invoking its methods..
      /// </summary>
      public interface IJumpHandler
      {
          UnityEvent SendJumpRequest { get; }
          UnityEvent SendJumpStop { get; }
      }
  }

This ``interface`` forces whatever implements it to give access to 2 Unity Events. One to request a jump to be performed and other to demand a jump to be stoped.
So as a Handler whenever you want a jump to be performed use the ``SendJumpRequest.Invoke()`` approach. Same goes for when you want to stop a jump with 
``SendJumpStop.Invoke()``. 

.. code-block:: csharp

  public class PlayableCharacterActions : MonoBehaviour, IJumpHandler
  {

    public UnityEvent sendJumpRequestEvent; // declare it as field so you can benefit from it on inspector
    public UnityEvent sendJumpStopEvent;

    public UnityEvent SendJumpRequest => sendJumpRequestEvent; // Dispose as getter to respect IJumpHandler interface
    public UnityEvent SendJumpStop => sendJumpStopEvent; 

    void Update() {

      if (JumpShouldBePerformed) 
      {
        sendJumpRequestEvent.Invoke();
      }

      if (JumpShouldBeStoped)
      {
        sendJumpStopEvent.Invoke();
      }

    }

  }


That allows us to, while crafting a "dynamic jump  performer" component, find any ``IJumpHandler`` among its ``GameObject`` components and listen to its 
events. Then, every time a ``SendJumpRequest`` is invoked by its handler, the component will receive it on its callback and handle if it should jump or not.

.. code-block:: csharp

  public class MyJumpPerformer : MonoBehaviour
  {

    IJumpHandler jumpHandler;

    void Start()
    {
      jumpHandler = GetComponent<IJumpHandler>();
      jumpHandler?.SendJumpRequest.AddListener(Request); // Listen to Jump Requests
      jumpHandler?.SendJumpStop.AddListener(Stop); // Listen to Stop demands  
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
      jumpHandler?.SendJumpRequest.RemoveListener(Request); // Stop listening to Jump Requests
      jumpHandler?.SendJumpStop.RemoveListener(Stop); // Stop listening to Stop demands
    }

    void Perform()
    {
      // Performs jump every physics update
    }
    
    void Request()
    {
      // Evaluate if jump can be perfomed and start it if so
    }

    void Stop()
    {
      // Stop any jump in progress
    }
  }

Well... we can easily see now how to benefit from the `unity's input system <https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/QuickStartGuide.html>`_ .
When jump button is pressed: ``SendJumpRequest.Invoke()``. When jump button is released: ``SendJumpStop.Invoke()``.

.. note::

  If you are not familiar with Unity Events you can `click here <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html>`_ and learn a bit more.

So, if you want to build your own handler for our ``DynamicJump`` component, just implement the ``IJumpHandler`` interface and activate the "Seek For Handler"
option in the ``DynamicJump`` component inspector window. Make sure to attach both components to the same ``GameObject``.

.. code-block:: csharp

  TODO: "Seeker" video

I use this strategy to all traits presented here. For another example you will find interfaces like ``IGroundingProvider`` so you can listen for updates 
on the ``GameObject`` being or not considered grounded. Even another example is the  ``IDashPerformer`` wich will allow you to find components that perform 
dynamic  dashes and listen for when the dash occur.

This is it for this first and most important principle. It is the "i interface my purpose" principle that glue all components together and allow you to 
grow your components from our work.

The "I can seek for information" principle
------------------------------------------

As seen in the previous principle, the ``DynamicJump`` can seek for its handler if you mark the inspector's option. Well... it is not the only one. 

All components that need some kind of information will have the option to seek for a component to feed that piece of intel under the "Seekers" section of its 
inspector window.

.. code-block:: csharp

  Todo: Seeker section image

For example, the ``DynamicDash`` needs to know about the grounding status of the ``GameObject`` it is attached to. In order to receive updates about grounding 
it can seek for a "grounding provider" wich will be a component that implements the ``IGroundingProvider`` interface. This way you can use our ``GoundingChecker`` 
component or implement your own component that provides information about its ``GameObject`` grounding status. All you will need to do is to make sure it implements
the ``IGroundingProvider`` interface and the ``DynamicDash`` will be able to find it and listen to the event that provides grounding information.

The "you can directly ask me" principle
---------------------------------------

Lastly, althoug I find it better to components be crafted "event drivenly" I like to leave open doors for a direct approach. And that is the reason for 
the "Seekers" section of our components on the inspector window to be completly optional. They **CAN** seek for information but if you prefer you can
directly feed the information they need and it will be documented on that component's page what method you can use to achieve that.

For example, the ``DynamicJump`` component have an ``UpdateGrounding(bool newGrounding)`` method wich is exactly the method used as callback when the 
"seek for grounding provider" option is enabled. So, when creating you own provider, if the "interfancing and eventing" approach is not for you,
just call the feeding method and pass in the argument your logic came up with.

.. code-block:: csharp

  bool grounded = MyWayToDetectGrounding();
  jump.UpdateGrounding(grounded);

And with that we end the principles. Now you can start looking at specific components documentation pages and understand how to interact and use them.
