Platformer Raycast Grounding Checker
====================================

This component is used to check if a ``GameObject`` can be considered on ground based on a given Collider2D component. It uses
3 points configurable through inspector to perform detection using raycasts. Each point position is determined based on the given 
collider lower bounds.

What it Requires
----------------

Through Unity's inspector you will need to inform what layers of your project should be considered ground. 

A ``Collider2D`` is required. It might be a ``BoxCollider2D``, a ``CapsuleCollider2D`` or even a ``CircleCollider2D``. You can directly 
specify one (pretty handy in case you are using multiple colliders). If no ``Collider2D`` is provided the component will try finding one. 

.. important::

   If you are working with multiple colliders be sure to specify one. Otherwise the wrong one might be used instead.

   public bool Grounded;

Events
******

You can add listeners through code or inspector to be updated every physics update about the 
``GameObject`` being or not grounded. 

.. code-block:: csharp

   public UnityEvent<bool> GroundingUpdate;

.. note::
