Character Controller
====================

We have actions and character controller separate because you may have stuff in your game that
perform actions but you do not consider it to be a character. A game manager for example can benefit
from our actions components but won't need to be controlled on the screen.

With that in mind here we have the bundle of components that are destined to... err... 
control characters.

We separate our character controller stuff in 3 sections:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   platformer/welcome
   top-down/welcome
   isometric/welcome

These are the 3 categories we will aim to deliver solutions about character controlling. But have in mind that our current goal is 
having a steady platformer character before moving on to explore the other 2 categories possibilities. But we will get there! =D

We also recommend understanding a bit on how we setup abilities

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   abilities/welcome
